        <section class="about">
            <h2>Hello! My name is Alvar Svardby</h2>
            <p>I come from the beautiful town of Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. I am currently 
                a student at <strong>Höga Kusten Theoretical High School (HKT)</strong>, 
                where I am in my second year. My academic journey at HKT has been both 
                challenging and rewarding, helping me build a strong foundation in 
                various subjects.</p>

            <p>I am a quick learner with a natural talent for shaping and 
                executing plans effectively. These skills have enabled me to tackle 
                various projects with confidence and precision. One of my proudest 
                achievements so far is <strong>designing and building a DC motor</strong>—a 
                project that tested my knowledge and problem-solving abilities. In 
                addition to this, I have also <strong>built several websites using 
                    HTML and CSS</strong>, which has further sparked my interest in 
                    technology and design.</p>

            <p>Outside of my academic studies, I have a wide range of interests. 
                I am passionate about <strong>strength training</strong> and appreciate 
                the discipline it brings to my life. My interest in building extends 
                beyond physical fitness—I also enjoy <strong>building computers</strong>, 
                where I can combine my technical knowledge with hands-on work.</p>

            <p>In my free time, you can often find me practicing <strong>karate</strong> 
                or hiking in the mountains, enjoying the beauty of nature. One of 
                my favorite places to ski is <strong>Åre</strong>, where I find both 
                challenge and joy in the slopes. I am also interested in <strong>stock 
                trading</strong>, a hobby that not only fascinates me but also keeps 
                me engaged in the financial world.</p>

            <p>Looking ahead, my goal is to one day become the <strong>CEO of a 
                company that I have built myself</strong>. I am determined to turn 
                my passion for learning, building, and leadership into a successful 
                business where I can create, innovate, and make a meaningful impact.</p>
