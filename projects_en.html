            <p>Here I share my experiences and insights as an active investor 
                in the stock market.</p>
            <p>I have been trading stocks since 2020, with a focus on the tech and 
                gaming industries. The opportunity to earn money by investing 
                in companies that drive innovation and entertainment captivated me 
                from the start.</p>
            <p>My trading strategy is a mix of swing and long-term strategies, 
                allowing me to take advantage of both short-term market movements 
                and the growth potential of promising companies over time.</p>
            <p>One of my notable investments was in AMD in early 2024, 
                where I successfully exited the trade after a few months, securing 
                a 20% return. Additionally, I have heavily invested in 
                Take-Two Interactive Software, a company I believe has significant 
                growth potential due to its strong portfolio and upcoming projects.</p>
            <p>I stay informed by thoroughly researching companies' 
                performance, future projects, and market trends. My ultimate goal 
                is to consistently beat the market by using a disciplined 
                trading strategy.</p>
            <p>However, my journey has not been without challenges. I once used 1:20 
                leverage on Bitcoin and unfortunately forgot to set a stop-loss, 
                resulting in a total loss of that investment. This 
                experience taught me the importance of risk management and staying 
                vigilant in the fast-paced trading world.</p>
