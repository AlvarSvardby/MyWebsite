        <section class="about">
            <h2>Take-Two Interactive Software</h2>
            <p>I have chosen to invest in Take-Two Interactive Software because they 
                own Rockstar Games, which is currently developing GTA 6. I believe this 
                game has the potential to generate enormous revenue. Additionally, they 
                also own 2K Games, which is producing Civilization VII, a game I also 
                expect to be successful.</p>
        
            <p>The projects I am most excited about are GTA 6 and Civilization 
                VII, both games that I believe will have a significant impact on the company's 
                future.</p>
        
            <p>My plan is to hold my shares in Take-Two Interactive Software until 
                early 2026. It has been important for me to be patient and 
                calm during this investment, as the stock price has fluctuated significantly, 
                with a fluctuation of up to 20 USD over the year.</p>

         <section class="about">
            <h2>Avanza Zero</h2>
            <p>I chose to buy Avanza Zero because it is a fund that tracks the 
                Swedish market and has no fees. This makes it a 
                cost-effective and accessible investment to gain exposure 
                to the Swedish stock market.</p>

            <p>Avanza Zero is a safe fund with no fees. It is a good 
                foundational investment for diversifying the portfolio without 
                having to worry about high costs.</p>

            <p>I don't have a specific plan for how long to hold the fund, but 
                I plan to keep it for at least a few years. This gives me time 
                to see returns and allow the fund's value to grow over time.</p>

            <p>My strategy is to "hodl" (hold) my investments. This means 
                that I do not plan to make any quick changes but instead 
                focus on long-term growth.</p>
